## [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

The [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) file specifies files and folders that should be left untracked by git to ensure that developers don't accidentally commit unwanted files. It is generally bad practice to include a gitignore file as big a the one in this repository, as environment-specific files (OS, IDE, et. al.) should instead be [ignored globally](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore) by the individual developer in order to keep project-specific gitignore files slim and maintainable.

The ignore list encompasses the following operating systems and editors, so you needn't worry about committing unwanted files if using any of these:

- OS X
- Windows
- Linux
- Archive files
- Mono Develop
- Netbeans
- Sublime Text
- TextMate
- Vim
- Visual Studio
- Visual Studio Code
- JetBrains IDEs
